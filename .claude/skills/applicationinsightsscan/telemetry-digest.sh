# telemetry-digest.sh — gather a production-telemetry digest from Azure
# Application Insights for the daily telemetry-anomaly routine.
#
# This is the deterministic data-gathering half of the routine: it runs a
# curated, fixed KQL set over a window and prints a Markdown digest. The
# routine's Claude session then reasons over this digest + GitHub activity to
# surface reliability/performance/risk signals (see
# .claude/skills/applicationinsightsscan/telemetry-rules.md).
#
# Credentials and egress are inherited from appinsights-query.sh (which this
# script calls): APPINSIGHTS_APP_ID / APPINSIGHTS_API_KEY env secrets, and the
# api.applicationinsights.io host on the environment's Custom egress allowlist.
#
# Usage:
#   .claude/skills/applicationinsightsscan/telemetry-digest.sh                 # default window P7D
#   .claude/skills/applicationinsightsscan/telemetry-digest.sh --timespan P1D  # last 24h
#
